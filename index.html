									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>
									Hello, I'm Sharon McDermott! I am originally from the sunny shores of Santa Monica, California; I ventured to 
										the vibrant city of Las Vegas at 10 years old, which I've since called home. My journey into data 
										science began with a profound desire to help others, which initially led me to pursue a Bachelor of 
										Arts in Psychology from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. There, I discovered the transformative 
										power of understanding human behavior and the potential to influence positive change through insightful 
										analysis. This deepening interest in research and data and my practical experiences in various 
										professional settings propelled me to pursue a Master of Science in Data Science. 
									</p>	
								</div>
								<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>
									Beyond my academic and professional life, I am an avid storyteller, a hobby that fills my home with notebooks 
										brimming with narratives. This passion for storytelling transcends into my professional work in data 
										science. I leverage narrative techniques to transform complex data sets into compelling, 
										understandable stories that inform and drive strategic decisions. I approach each challenge with a 
										blend of analytical rigor and creative flair.
									</p>	
								</div>
								<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>
									I focus on solving problems and crafting data narratives that elucidate the why and how of policy 
										impacts and organizational improvements to make informative decisions. By integrating my background in 
										psychology with my skills in data science, I aim to foster environments where data informs and inspires 
										action.

									<h2>Philosphy</h2>
								</header>
								<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>
									Welcome! As a Data Science graduate with a specialty in data management and analytics. I am dedicated to 
										enhancing program efficiency and effectiveness within public sectors. My philosophy is rooted in 
										using a utilitarian approach, focusing on maximizing community well-being through strategic data use. 
										This ethical philosophy guides my efforts toward transparency and integrity, 
										aiming to deliver informed, ensuring compassionate data-driven decisions to enhance program efficiency and 
										overall societal good. Data science is more than just a profession to me—it's a responsibility and 
										critical instrument in modern governance and healthcare. Utilizing meticulous research and strategic 
										analytics, I work to uncover patterns that lead to innovative policies and interventions, aiming to 
										enhance individual and community lives.

									<h2>Experience</h2>
								</header>
								<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>
									As a former Forensic Specialist at the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, I managed a blend of 
										security and client care within a secure mental health facility, overseeing the custody and treatment 
										of mentally ill offenders. This role required rigorous law enforcement duties alongside direct 
										healthcare support, ensuring adherence to legal mandates, and assisting in patient rehabilitation. My 
										career transitioned into healthcare research where, as a Research Coordinator at Cleveland Clinic and 
										Retina Consultants of Nevada, I managed complex research protocols and collaborated with principal 
										investigators. This involved patient screening, data collection, and specimen processing, significantly 
										boosting my expertise in data system management and clinical data integrity. Subsequently, at the 
										National University, I furthered my role in academia as a Research Assistant, supporting grant writing 
										and project management while applying research integrity and effectiveness. These cumulative 
										experiences underpinned my dedication to data, integrity, and innovation in improving healthcare 
										outcomes and academic research efficacy.
