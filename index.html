									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Welcome! As a Data Science graduate with expertise in data science, research, and data management,
                                    I aim to apply my skills to improve program efficiency and operational effectiveness.
                                    My focus is on enhancing data security and supporting data-driven decision-making through IT systems management within federal agencies.
                                    <div>
                                    Inspired by Carl Sagan's reflection on the 'Pale Blue Dot' photograph, I am reminded of the profound impact and responsibility we hold
                                    as individuals. Sagan's message underscores the potential for data science to leverage vast amounts of information and enact meaningful,
                                    positive changes in our global community. By applying data science principles, I aspire to make significant contributions that improve
                                    lives and fostering a sense of unity among the people of this 'pale blue dot': our home.

									<h2>My Experience</h2>
								</header>
								<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>
									With my background in data science and experience in research coordination, I have developed a strong skill set 
                                    in managing and analyzing complex datasets. At Cleveland Clinic and Retina Consultants of Nevada,
                                    I collaborated with principal investigators and sponsors, ensuring compliance with research protocols
                                    while handling sensitive clinical data. I was responsible for patient screening, data collection, and specimen
                                    processing, which strengthened my ability to manage large data systems while maintaining data accuracy and
                                    integrity. This hands-on experience with healthcare data has honed my skills in research, data management,
                                    and drawing insights from clinical data, all essential for driving data-informed decisions.

								<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>
                                    Furthermore, my role as a Research Assistant at National University has been instrumental in supporting
                                    academics with grant pursuits and grant writing. This experience has provided me with a unique perspective
                                    on the integration of data analytics to enhance grant proposals, ensuring that research projects are
                                    well-supported by data-driven evidence and sound methodologies.

                                    Moreover, my role as a Forensic Specialist at the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services reinforced
                                    my ability to apply data analytics in regulatory environments. This experience, paired with my technical
                                    skills and commitment to improving program efficiency, positions me to contribute effectively in high-impact
                                    roles such as a program analyst or data scientist within federal agencies. By leveraging data to inform
                                    policy and operational decisions, I am well-equipped to support federal initiatives that rely on
                                    data-driven insights for success.

                                    In addition to my practical experience, my educational focus on Database Analytics within my Master's in Data
                                    Science has equipped me with technical expertise in SQL, Python, and machine learning. I’ve applied these 
                                    skills in various data-driven projects, using statistical techniques to analyze both continuous and categorical 
                                    data. My proficiency in designing databases and employing machine learning algorithms allows me to build
                                    and refine predictive models for optimizing decision-making processes. This combination of practical
                                    experience and technical knowledge enables me to tackle complex data challenges and develop solutions
                                    grounded in statistical rigor and advanced analytics.
