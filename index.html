									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>
									Hello, I'm Sharon McDermott! I am originally from the sunny shores of Santa Monica, California; I ventured to 
										the vibrant city of Las Vegas at 10 years old, which I've since called home. My journey into data 
										science began with a profound desire to help others, which initially led me to pursue a Bachelor of 
										Arts in Psychology from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. There, I discovered the transformative 
										power of understanding human behavior and the potential to influence positive change through insightful 
										analysis.
									</p>	
								</div>
								<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>
									Beyond my academic and professional life, I am an avid storyteller, a hobby that fills my home with notebooks 
										brimming with narratives. This passion for storytelling transcends into my professional work in data 
										science. I leverage narrative techniques to transform complex data sets into compelling, 
										understandable stories that inform and drive strategic decisions. I approach each challenge with a 
										blend of analytical rigor and creative flair.
									</p>	
								</div>
								<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>
									I am dedicated to enhancing data security and supporting data-driven decision-making within federal agencies. 
										I focus on solving problems and crafting data narratives that elucidate the why and how of policy 
										impacts and organizational improvements to make informative decisions. By integrating my background in 
										psychology with my skills in data science, I aim to foster environments where data informs and inspires 
										action.

									<h2>Experience</h2>
								</header>
								<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>
									With my background in data science and experience in research coordination, I have developed a strong skill set 
                                    in managing and analyzing complex datasets. At Cleveland Clinic and Retina Consultants of Nevada,
                                    I collaborated with principal investigators and sponsors, ensuring compliance with research protocols
                                    while handling sensitive clinical data. I was responsible for patient screening, data collection, and specimen
                                    processing, which strengthened my ability to manage large data systems while maintaining data accuracy and
                                    integrity. This hands-on experience with healthcare data has honed my skills in research, data management,
                                    and drawing insights from clinical data, all essential for driving data-informed decisions.

								<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>
                                    Furthermore, my role as a Research Assistant at National University has been instrumental in supporting
                                    academics with grant pursuits and grant writing. This experience has provided me with a unique perspective
                                    on the integration of data analytics to enhance grant proposals, ensuring that research projects are
                                    well-supported by data-driven evidence and sound methodologies.

                                    Moreover, my role as a Forensic Specialist at the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services reinforced
                                    my ability to apply data analytics in regulatory environments. This experience, paired with my technical
                                    skills and commitment to improving program efficiency, positions me to contribute effectively in high-impact
                                    roles such as a program analyst or data scientist within federal agencies. By leveraging data to inform
                                    policy and operational decisions, I am well-equipped to support federal initiatives that rely on
                                    data-driven insights for success.

                                    In addition to my practical experience, my educational focus on Database Analytics within my Master's in Data
                                    Science has equipped me with technical expertise in SQL, Python, and machine learning. I’ve applied these 
                                    skills in various data-driven projects, using statistical techniques to analyze both continuous and categorical 
                                    data. My proficiency in designing databases and employing machine learning algorithms allows me to build
                                    and refine predictive models for optimizing decision-making processes. This combination of practical
                                    experience and technical knowledge enables me to tackle complex data challenges and develop solutions
                                    grounded in statistical rigor and advanced analytics.
