                        Welcome to my portfolio! As a Data Science graduate with expertise in data science, research, and data management,
                        I aim to apply my skills to improve program efficiency and operational effectiveness.
                        My focus is on enhancing data security and supporting data-driven decision-making through IT systems management within federal agencies.
                        <br>
                        Inspired by Carl Sagan's reflection on the 'Pale Blue Dot' photograph, I am reminded of the profound impact and responsibility we hold
                        as individuals. Sagan's message underscores the potential for data science to leverage vast amounts of information and enact meaningful,
                        positive changes in our global community. By applying data science principles, I aspire to make significant contributions that improve
                        lives and foster a sense of unity among the people of this 'pale blue dot': our home.

                    <p>
                        With my background in data science and experience in research coordination, I have developed a strong skill set 
                        in managing and analyzing complex datasets. At Cleveland Clinic and Retina Consultants of Nevada,
                        I collaborated with principal investigators and sponsors, ensuring compliance with research protocols
                        while handling sensitive clinical data. I was responsible for patient screening, data collection, and specimen
                        processing, which strengthened my ability to manage large data systems while maintaining data accuracy and
                        integrity. This hands-on experience with healthcare data has honed my skills in research, data management,
                        and drawing insights from clinical data, all essential for driving data-informed decisions.
                        <br>
                        Furthermore, my role as a Research Assistant at National University has been instrumental in supporting
                        academics with grant pursuits and grant writing. This experience has provided me with a unique perspective
                        on the integration of data analytics to enhance grant proposals, ensuring that research projects are
                        well-supported by data-driven evidence and sound methodologies.
                        <br>
                        Moreover, my role as a Forensic Specialist at the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services reinforced
                        my ability to apply data analytics in regulatory environments. This experience, paired with my technical
                        skills and commitment to improving program efficiency, positions me to contribute effectively in high-impact
                        roles such as a program analyst or data scientist within federal agencies. By leveraging data to inform
                        policy and operational decisions, I am well-equipped to support federal initiatives that rely on
                        data-driven insights for success.
